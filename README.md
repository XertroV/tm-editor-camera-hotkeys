# Warp to Waypoint

Editor helper to quickly navigate between CPs/Waypoints.

Supports both blocks and items. Auto-refreshes when you add/remove blocks or items (can be disabled in settings). Waypoints are sorted by their type, first, then whether they're linked or not, then their CP groups.

Indicators:
- Block/Item
- Current Color
- Start/Finish/Checkpoint/StartFinish
- Linked Status
- CP Group

Prior work: Beu's Blocks & Items Counter.
